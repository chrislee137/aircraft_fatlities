The purpose of this analysis is to prove that flight passenger saftey has little to no effect on if they will survive an aircraft crash. This includes a data set that contains 4,967 Rows and 17 Columns. It includes all the crash data from around the world since 1908. The Notebook includes the analysis of the years between 2014-2019. The reason for only comparing 5 years instead of the whole 111 years, is because that much data will water down the results since it included Zeeplins and other experemental aicraft.
