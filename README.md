The purpose of this analysis is to prove that flight passenger saftey has little to no effect on if they will survive an aircraft crash. This includes a data set that contains 4,967 Rows and 17 Columns. It includes all the crash data from around the world since 1908. The Notebook includes the analysis of the years between 2014-2019. The reason for only comparing 5 years instead of the whole 111 years, is because that much data will water down the results since it included Zeeplins and other experemental aicraft.
A p-value with beta coefficients have been assigned to the data using the proper tools and techniques.
There is a bar and plot chart that visually shows the data captured and analyzied. This visual representation hightlights this analysis failure to reject the null hypothesis. 
This analysis failed to reject the null hypothesis.
